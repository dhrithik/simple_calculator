# simple_calculator
Hello! My name is Dhrithik and I'm learning to code. This is my very first GitHub repository and it might seem a little cringe to post this 
project but I'm still learning and this seemed like a good start. 

I made a simple GUI calculator using the tkinter module in python. It can add, subtract, multiply and divide the numbers which are given by the user.

Peace!
